# Wind Energy Feasibility Analysis in Kenya

## Description

This project conducts a data-driven feasibility analysis of wind energy production in Kenya. The goal is to identify optimal locations for wind farms, leveraging various data science techniques. The analysis includes assessing wind patterns, speeds, and potential energy output across different regions in Kenya.

## Objectives

- Conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis to recommend optimal wind farm locations in Kenya.
- Analyze regional wind data to determine areas with high energy output potential.
- Implement a predictive wind gust model for enhanced operational efficiency.
